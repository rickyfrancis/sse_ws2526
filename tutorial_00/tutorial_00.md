**Introduction to C#**

---

### Task 1

The programming language of the tutorial is C#. Read any C#-Tutorial of your choice (e.g. [homeandlearn.co.uk](http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/csharp/csharp_s1p1.html)) and create a simple "HelloWorld" console application using Visual Studio. Visual Studio Community can be downloaded from [Microsoft](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). We do NOT recommend Visual Studio Code for the tutorial, as it does not provide support for .NET Framework features used later in the tutorial.

### Task 2

Answer the following questions briefly and accurately in your own words:

1. What are the responsibilities of the .NET Framework?
2. What is common to C#, VB.NET, F# and J#?
3. What are the Lambda-Expressions and LINQ?
